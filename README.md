# Plot scripts for review article "Extended scalar sectors" https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-nucl-032620-043846

Each script creates a plot summarising limits from different searches, with the raw data available in according subdirectories, either obtained from experimental collaborations or from phenomenologists directly, or using https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/ when needed.

* `plot_hmssm.py`: Limits in hMSSM interpretation
* `plot_2hdms.py`: Limits for 2HDM+S interpretation, type II and tan(beta) = 2.
* `plot_singlet.py`: Limits for singlet interpretation, also for fixed tan(beta), following https://inspirehep.net/literature/1751580

### Requirements

Requires a reasonably recent version of [ROOT](https://ph-root-2.cern.ch/) compiled with Python support (tested with Python 3 but 2 should also work).
